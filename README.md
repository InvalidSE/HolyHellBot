# HolyHellBot
*A bot that counts a given chess.com user's en passants and bongcloud openings.*

**THE PLAN:**\
\> To create a bot (discord / reddit) that anyone can request a username and the bot will reply.\
\> The idea is to give this power to those that would reply 'holy hell' to 'google en passant.'\
\> And maybe even a leaderboard?! (We'll see)
